    <string name="about_pefasb">THE .PENTECOSTAL EVANGELISTIC FELLOWSHIP OF AFRICA (P.E.F.A.)developed
        from the partnership and merger of churches that had been founded by Elim Fellowship (formerly Elim Missionaries Assemblies,
        who\'s Headquarters are in Lima, New York, USA and the International Pentecostal Assemblies (now known as International
        Pentecostal Churches of Christ, who\'s Headquarters are located in London, Ohio, USA). These two missionary bodies agreed to unite
        their churches to form the Pentecostal Evangelistic Fellowship of Africa. \n\n P.E.F.A. in essence means: a vibrant Pentecostal Church where
        the ministry gifts of the Holy Spirit are in operation in the lives of the church members. It is an Evangelist Church, envisioned to
        preach the Full Gospel of Jesus Christ - salvation, healing and baptism of the Holy Spirit. It is also a church where believers
        fellowship together and recognize themselves as the very body of Jesus Christ. Last but not least, P.E.F.A. is a Continental Church
        that has spread its wings across the Continent of Africa. As this history is being written, P.E.F.A. Church has spread its wings to
        other countries of the world.</string>
